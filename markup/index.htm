            <p class="about__text">
                We, at Entree, are the largest Indian agency fighting against food wastage and ending hunger. In the upcoming 10 years, our dream of a society prospering with food security will become a reality. Our plan of action is pioneering and our goals are ambitious. Comprising a team of determined and zealous personas, ranging from students to senior citizens, we have got what it takes. 
            </p>
            <p class="about__text">
                Our method includes twin pillars of transparency and sustainability. Firmly believing in the 17 Sustainable Development Goals, as set up by the United Nations Environment Program, our duty towards society comes before everything. Starting from a small apartment in Bangalore in 2019, we have come a long way, already having received more than a hundred thousand donations feeding more than five million hungry citizens. And we have no intention to stop in our way. 
            </p>
            <p class="about__text">
                Acclaimed by the Ministry of food and distribution, we place our trust in you, those who see your own dream come true with our work. Motivated by the smiles of the hungry, our belief in the collective good is unparalleled. This fact is exemplified by our appearance in the Times Magazine and Forbes, as one of the 30 best socially conscious start-ups of 2010s. We constitute the crusaders of change, who change the present for our better tomorrow.

                        More than 40% of food in India is wasted, accounting for 92,000 rupees per annum. On the other side of the spectrum, 189.2 million people in India are malnourished due to inadequate food supply and hunger. Bridging the gap between these two emergencies will help us combat both problems.

Using our user friendly website, you can donate this food to Entree, and we will collect it from you to distribute in the village nearby. As more people than ever are in need of food, we act as the bridge between the 2 problems.

                    We are never full of employees. We started this initiative staring at the tip of the iceberg and as we dig on deeper, our family keeps on expanding, and it never just feels enough. We started with just 10 enthusiasts and now we are spread all over the country with more than a thousand believers of our goal. If you too feel that you need to do something regarding the problem, rather than sitting and discussion, we are nearby.
